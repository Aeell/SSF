Super Slam Football - Project Status Report
=======================================

1. CURRENT STATE
---------------
- Server running on port 3001
- Webpack dev server on port 3000
- Game components initialized but not fully functional
- CSP issues blocking proper script execution
- Loading screen implementation incomplete

2. CRITICAL ISSUES
-----------------
a) Content Security Policy:
   - Current CSP too restrictive
   - eval() blocking affecting webpack hot reload
   - Script execution limitations affecting game initialization

b) Asset Loading:
   - Loading screen stuck at initialization
   - Game assets not properly loading
   - No proper asset loading progress tracking

c) Performance:
   - Large bundle size (5.56 MiB)
   - Runtime modules overhead
   - No code splitting implemented

3. DEBUGGING OUTPUT
------------------
Console Logs:
- Server startup successful
- Webpack compilation successful
- Game components initialization attempted
- CSP violations reported
- Unload event deprecation warning

Network Status:
- WebSocket connection established
- Proxy routes configured correctly
- Static asset serving functional

4. IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
------------------------
1. CSP Configuration:
   - Move CSP configuration to server-side
   - Implement nonce-based CSP
   - Configure webpack to use nonce for dynamic scripts

2. Asset Management:
   - Implement proper asset preloading
   - Add asset loading progress tracking
   - Create asset manifest

3. Build Optimization:
   - Implement code splitting
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Add production build configuration

5. MVP ROADMAP
-------------
Phase 1 - Core Game (Current Focus):
- Fix CSP and loading issues
- Implement basic player movement
- Add ball physics interaction
- Create simple scoring system

Phase 2 - Basic Gameplay:
- Add multiplayer support
- Implement basic AI
- Add sound effects
- Create simple UI

Phase 3 - Polish:
- Add animations
- Improve graphics
- Add game modes
- Implement scoring system

6. TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
------------------------
1. Build System:
   - Split webpack config for dev/prod
   - Implement proper source maps
   - Add asset optimization

2. Game Engine:
   - Improve physics system
   - Add entity component system
   - Implement proper game loop

3. Networking:

   - Add lag compensation

7. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES
---------------------------
1. Immediate (Next 24 Hours):
   - Fix CSP configuration
   - Implement proper asset loading
   - Add basic player controls

2. Short-term (Week 1):
   - Complete basic gameplay mechanics
   - Add multiplayer foundation
   - Implement basic UI

3. Medium-term (Week 2-3):
   - Add game modes
   - Implement scoring
   - Add basic AI

8. TECHNICAL DEBT
----------------
- Webpack configuration needs cleanup
- Asset loading system needs restructuring
- Physics system needs optimization
- Network code needs refactoring

9. RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------

   - Add proper event system

3. Performance:
   - Implement proper asset loading
   - Add code splitting
   - Optimize render pipeline

10. NEXT STEPS
-------------
1. Fix CSP by:
   - Moving CSP to server
   - Implementing proper nonce
   - Configuring webpack correctly

2. Implement proper asset loading:
   - Create asset manifest
   - Add progress tracking
   - Implement preloading

3. Add basic gameplay:
   - Player movement
   - Ball physics
   - Simple scoring

11. CONCLUSION
-------------
The project has a solid foundation but requires immediate attention to CSP and asset loading issues. The focus should be on creating a playable MVP while maintaining code quality and performance. The proposed roadmap provides a clear path to achieve these goals while addressing technical debt and future scalability.
