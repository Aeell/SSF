SUPER SLAM FOOTBALL - PROJECT ANALYSIS
====================================

CURRENT STATE
------------
1. Development Environment:
   - Node.js/Express backend (Port 3001)
   - Webpack dev server (Port 3000)
   - Three.js for 3D rendering
   - Socket.IO for real-time communication

2. Critical Issues:
   a) Game Initialization Failure:
      - Game fails to initialize properly
      - Black screen after initial loading
      - CSP blocks eval despite configuration attempts
      
   b) Architecture Issues:
      - Conflict between GameClient and Game class implementations
      - Multiple initialization approaches causing confusion
      - Inconsistent state management

3. Current Implementation:
   - Basic 3D scene setup with Three.js
   - Loading screen implementation
   - Network manager for multiplayer
   - Performance overlay component
   - Basic error handling and logging

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
-----------------
1. Code Structure Issues:
   a) Dual Game Initialization:
      - GameClient class in index.js
      - Separate Game class in Game.js
      - Conflicting initialization flows

   b) Asset Loading:
      - LoadingManager setup but no actual asset loading
      - Missing texture and model loading implementation
      - No asset preloading system

   c) Network Implementation:
      - Basic Socket.IO setup
      - Missing proper connection handling
      - No game state synchronization

2. Build System:
   - Webpack configuration issues:
     * HMR conflicts with WebSocket
